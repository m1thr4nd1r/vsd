## VSD (Viajante Sem Destino)

This project meant to help people find trips to do, technically by any means of transportation, based on the money they are willing to spend, and the amount of days they have avaliable.

Initially this project had a prototype on PHP, as part of a university task, but there were a wish to port it to python and use more resources to make it more usable. So this project comes ready to deploy on heroku, but it still misses the bulk of code required.

However, this project will be frozen for now, so feel free to use it if this idea picks your interest :)
